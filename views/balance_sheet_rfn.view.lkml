#########################################################{
# PURPOSE
# The BalanceSheet table and its corresponding View balance_sheet reflects
# an aggregation of Transactions by the following dimensions:
#   Client
#   Fiscal Year
#   Fiscal Period
#   Company Code
#   Chart of Accounts
#   Hierarchy Name
#   Business Area
#   Ledger
#   Node
#   Languague
#   Global (Target) Currency
#
# SOURCES
# Refines View balance_sheet (defined in file balance_sheet_base.view)
# Extends View common_fields_finance_ext
#
# REFERENCED BY
# Explore balance_sheet
#
# EXTENDED FIELDS
# Extends common dimensions found in both balance sheet and profit and loss
#   client_mandt, language_key_spras, currency_key, target_currency_tcurr, ledger_in_general_ledger_accounting, company_code, company_text, chart_of_accounts, business_area,
#   fiscal_period, fiscal_quarter, fiscal_year and related fields
# Make changes to these dimensions in the common_fields_finance_ext view or
# in this view if the changes are specific to the Balance Sheet.
#
# KEY MEASURES
#    Amount in Local Currency, Amount in Global Currency
#    Cumulative Amount in Local Currency, Cumulative Amount in Global Currency
#    Exchange Rate (based on last date in the period)
#    Avg Exchange Rate, Max Exchange Rate
#    Current Ratio, Current Assets, and Current Liabilities
#
# CAVEATS
# Current Ratio and related measures are defined using English-only terms found in Node (text).
# Edit these as necessary to support other languages or use Node values instead of text.
#
# HOW TO USE
# To query this table, always include Fiscal Year and Fiscal Period as dimensions
# and filter to:
#   - a single Client MANDT (handled with Constant defined in Manifest file)
#   - a single Language (the Explore based on this view uses User Attribute locale to select language in joined view language_map_sdt)
#   - a single Global Currency
#   - a single Hierarchy Name or Financial Statement Version
#   - a single Chart of Accounts
#   - a single Company
